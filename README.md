🎯 Why This Project Matters for MERN Stack

Although this project is built with Vanilla JavaScript, it showcases the foundation required for MERN development, including:

JavaScript logic before frameworks (React readiness)

State handling concepts

UI updates based on state changes

Event-driven programming

Code organization and readability

These skills directly translate to:

React components

Redux / Context state management

Backend logic thinking (Node.js)

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add difficulty levels

Mobile touch controls

Sound effects

React version of the game

Backend leaderboard using Node.js & MongoDB
